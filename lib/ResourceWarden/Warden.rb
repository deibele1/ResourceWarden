# Resource Exclusion class
# A block is passed which will then be encapsulated in a thread immediately joined by the current thread.
# This allows requests for multiple resources and guarantees a lock on all resources will be granted
# as soon as all prior virtual threads with a claim on a resource terminate.
# The warden calls the cell which generates a key which will join the prior resource claimant and change ownership
# of the resource when used. Attempting to use a resource without ownership will result in an exception.
# Auto joining in this way ensures no resource starvation, no deadlocks, no live-locks and true concurrency.
# Tasks should be kept small when using this model and all tasks must eventually terminate.
# This model can solve a generalized dining philosophers problem with any resource exclusion structure.
